This folder contains material to help benchmark the following runaway electron RFP case

Primary steady state distribution
Slab geometry
Z = 5;
E = 3.5E_c;
v = 0.1c;
alpha(sr) = 0.1;

Graphs of previous results are included, alongside the benchmarking script "benchmark_primary_slab.py" which calculates O and X points, as well as the bump location in f_p. These can guide us to determine if the code is still producing good results.
