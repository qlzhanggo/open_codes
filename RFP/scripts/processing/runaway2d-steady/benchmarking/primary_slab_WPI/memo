This folder contains material to help benchmark the following runaway electron RFP case

Primary steady state distribution with Wave Particle Interaction
Slab geometry
Z = 1;
E = 3.0E_c;
v = 0.1c;
alpha(sr) = 0.05 and 0.2;

w0 = 0.25; ?? NG: Need to confirm how Zehua's \vareps_0 translates to this variable
k10 = 0.2;
k20 = 0.1;
dk10 = 0.05;
wpe = 1.;

Graphs of previously published results are included here to help confirm accuracy of the result. Guo et al. - 2018 - Control of runaway electron energy using externally injected whistler waves 10.1063/1.5019381
